# Waffle Server - Vizabi integration

Integration script [is here](./ws-vizabi).

Before this script use please, read carefully the next comments:

## Next soft should be alive:
 1. MongoDB
 2. Redis
 3. Neo4J (!password=`neo4j`)
 4. WS and Vizabi Tools should not be alive

### You can use next command for stop all of `NodeJS` instances (WS or Vizabi Tools):
`kill $(ps aux | grep 'node ' | awk '{print $2}')`

## Usage:
 1. Create a separate directory.
 2. Put this script into the directory.
 3. Put [run script](./run) from current directory into the directory.
 4. Edit [run script](./run) script: put into this script AWS S3 credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, S3_BUCKET).
 5. Run this script.

## Specification of query accepted by WS API
please read [query specification accepted by WS Public API](ws-public-api.md)

## Starting auto-generating documentation:
 - to view the local versions of the documentation, you need run ` ./swagger.sh `, also can specify the HOST using param ` WS_URL `, default ` localhost:3000 `
 - to view for documentation through [editor swagger] (http://editor.swagger.io/#/) need to go the route `/swagger-docs.json`
 - to view swagger.json take the route `/api-docs.json'`

## Supported gulp tasks:

```
├── lint
├── test
├── test:e2e
├── swagger
└─ default
 ├── lint
 ├── test
 └── swagger
```

1. `gulp lint` - checks codebase using `eslint`
2. `gulp swagger` - generates swagger.json based on the swagger-jsdoc comments in the code
3. `gulp test` - runs all the unit tests
4. `gulp test:e2e` - runs all the end to end tests


## Release
1. `npm run changelog` - generates content for `CHANGELOG.md` file with changes that have happened since last release
2. `npm version` - this one is a bit more complicated. Let's start with what it needs in order to run.
  - `CONVENTIONAL_GITHUB_RELEASER_TOKEN` environment variable should be set up for this command:

    Example: `CONVENTIONAL_GITHUB_RELEASER_TOKEN=aaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccffffffffff npm version minor`

  - this command understands following parameters:
    - `major` (having initially version **0.0.0** by applying this option it will be changed to **1.0.0**).

        Example:
        ```
          CONVENTIONAL_GITHUB_RELEASER_TOKEN=aaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccffffffffff npm version major
        ```

    - `minor` (having initially version **0.0.0** by applying this option it will be changed to **0.1.0**)

        Example:
        ```
          CONVENTIONAL_GITHUB_RELEASER_TOKEN=aaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccffffffffff npm version minor
        ```

    - `patch` (having initially version **0.0.0** by applying this option it will be changed to **0.0.1**)

        Example:
        ```
          CONVENTIONAL_GITHUB_RELEASER_TOKEN=aaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccffffffffff npm version patch
        ```

    During the release process two files will be changed and pushed to github:
      1. CHANGELOG.md - because of added history.
      2. package.json - because of bumped version.

    **Note:** `aaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccffffffffff` - is the fake token. In order to generate proper one you need to do following: [github tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use)

    **Important note:** you should merge `development` branch into `master` and **performing `npm verison` on `master`** branch according to our [gitflow](https://github.com/valor-software/valor-style-guides/tree/master/gitflow)

    **Even more important note:** while generating token (using tutorial given above) you need to choose which permissions should be granted to it. For our *release purposes* you need to choose all permissions under the section `repo`
